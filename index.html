               <p id="text1" class="col-9">I was born to Chinese immigrants, Yip and Su, and was raised in Belize, a small
                Central American country neighboring Guatemala. Since I was a small child,
                I was taught how to speak several languages in order to communicate with
                those around me. I am grateful for the childhood that I had because I was
                surrounded by different cultures and learned to appreciate the different walks
                of life that people come from. At the age of 13, my family and I relocated to Brooklyn, NY where we lived
                for 3 years before making Washington our home.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <p id="text2" class="col-md-12"> After working retail for 8 years, I joined the corporate world working in Sales Operations
                for a start up company specializing in developing telematics and software for fleet management.
                In my free time I enjoy being outdoors, hiking, finding every swimming hole that
                Washington has to offer and riding on the back of my husband's Harley,
                granted the weather is nice. I also enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends
                or staying in on rainy Washington nights and watching horror movies.
